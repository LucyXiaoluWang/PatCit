## Extract, Parse

For the extraction and parsing tasks, we build on [**Grobid**](./awesome#softwares-and-libraries), a machine learning library for extracting, parsing and restructuring raw documents such as patent documents and citations.

## Consolidate

For the consolidation task, we build on [**biblio-glutton**](./awesome#softwares-and-libraries), a framework dedicated to bibliographic information with a powerful bibliographical matching service.

## Data pipeline

These services are articulated in an efficient data pipeline in the cloud to process up to 2 million citations per day and 300k full-text patents per day.
