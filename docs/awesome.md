## Softwares and Libraries

- Grobid ([GitHub][grobid-gh],Â [Doc][grobid-doc]) is a machine learning library for extracting, parsing and re-structuring raw documents such as PDF into structured XML/TEI encoded documents with a particular focus on technical and scientific publications. First developments started in 2008 as a hobby. In 2011 the tool has been made available in open source. Work on GROBID has been steady as a side project since the beginning and is expected to continue as such.
- Biblio-glutton ([GitHub][biblio-glutton]) is a bibliographical reference matching service. From an input such as a raw bibliographical reference and/or a combination of key metadata, the service returns the disambiguated bibliographical object with in particular its DOI and a set of metadata aggregated from [**CrossRef**](./vocabulary#crossref), [**PubMed**](./vocabulary#pubmed) and other awesome bibliographical resources.
- spaCy ([GitHub][spaCy-gh], [Doc][spaCy-doc]) is an Industrial-Strength Natural Language Processing Python library.
- Doccano ([GitHub][doccano-gh], [Demo][doccano-demo]) is an open source text annotation tool for machine learning practitioners.
